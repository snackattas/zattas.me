    <p>Hey, I'm Zach.  I'm a test evangelist, developer, healthcare enthusiast, chef, Type 1 diabetic, and lifelong learner.  Right
    now I work at <a class="black" href="https://www.jellyvision.com/team/zach-attas/" target="_blank">Jellyvision</a> in Chicago as a Software Development Engineer in Test.   I'm also currently enrolled in Udacity's <a class="black" href="https://www.udacity.com/ai">Artificial Intelligence Engineer Nanodegree</a>.   I love gaining new tech skills in my spare time.</p>
    <p>I graduated from Wesleyan University in 2013 with a degree in
    Philosophy and the <a class="black" href="http://www.wesleyan.edu/sisp/" target="_blank">Science in Society Program</a>.  I chose Philosophy because I like to ask big questions.   I chose the Science in Society Program because, yea, science is great, but I wanted tools to be able to question science.  And I still have that questioning attitude today!</p>
    <p>Programming was a skill I picked up post-college at Epic. I was a Quality Assurance Analyst, and to excel at my job I learned​ <a href="http://www.intersystems.com/our-products/cache/cache-overview/" target="_blank">Caché</a>.  With this new skill, I began to write small scripts to make testing easier.  Next, I began
to test at the API level.  Soon after, I was writing unit tests.
A year after starting at Epic, I was no longer intimidated by technical concepts.  I was testing heavily
technical areas like environment management, batch scheduling, auditing, indexing, etc.
    <p>I was hooked on programming.   I decided to depart from Epic after working there for &gt;2 years for 2 reasons:  (1) I wanted to cook full time (I’ve always had a passion for food) and (2) I wanted to learn more about programming.   I got a job as a chef with a new restaurant group called the <a href="http://www.eater.com/maps/best-new-restaurants-madison/robinia-courtyard" target="_blank">Robinia Courtyard</a>, working with a team of ambitious chefs from Chicago.   In my off-hours I studied programming through <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004" target="_blank">Udacity</a>.

    <p>But I'd say that only 30% percent of my skills came from Udacity.  The rest are from a random assortment of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), textbooks, podcasts, blogposts, stack overflow articles, meetup.com events,  code documentation, and small projects.  Self-directed learning is my thing.</p>
<p>And that's my favorite part of web development so far -- since the field's always changing, there's always so much to learn.  I'm ready to rise to the challenge, leave my comfort zone, and code!</p>
