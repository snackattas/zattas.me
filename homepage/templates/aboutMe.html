    <p>Hey, I'm Zach. I majored in philosophy in college, so I have always enjoyed questioning things.Â 
      Post college, I took a Quality Assurance job, not really knowing what it was, but knowing that I would be working for a cool, exciting software company.</p>
    <p>
      Once I learned what testing was all about, I discovered that I liked it! It appealed to the same part of my brain that liked philosophy. In pursuit of more testing expertise, I began digging 'under the hood' by teaching myself some light
      programming -- and
      soon I was hooked, scriping test setup and contributing unit tests.
      Now I'm a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET), and haven't looked back since. I currently work at
      <a href="https://www.reviewtrackers.com/careers/" target="_blank">ReviewTrackers</a> in Chicago as their Lead SDET.
    </p>

    <p>I love digging into problems. I am self-taught, so my programming education comes from a random assortment of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), textbooks,
      podcasts, blogposts, stack overflow articles, meetup.com events, and small projects. When I'm not learning, I'm taking photography classes,
      improv classes, cooking something yummy, or managing the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Chicago-Seleniumistas/" target="_blank">Chicago Seleniumistas Meetup Group</a>.</p>
