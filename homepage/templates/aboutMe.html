    <p>Hey, I'm Zach. I'm a full stack developer, healthcare enthusiast,
    technologist,
    lifelong learner, chef, type-1 diabetic, and friend. Right
    now I'm studying web development.</p>
    <p>I love to experiment. When cooking, I'll always have
    a new batch of something fermented on hand. When writing short stories, I always come up with out-of-the-box premises. When traveling, I always leave part of my carefully-planned itinerary blank (for novel adventures to occur in). </p>
    <p>I graduated from Wesleyan University in 2013 with a degree in
    Philosophy and the <a class="black" href="http://www.wesleyan.edu/sisp/" target="_blank">Science in Society Program</a>. I chose Philosophy because I like to ask big questions.  I chose the Science in Society Program because I like science, but I wanted tools to  question scientific practice.  Also, it's a mouthful to say.</p>
    <p>At Epic, my first job post-college, I learned​ <a href="http://www.intersystems.com/our-products/cache/cache-overview/" target="_blank">Caché</a>. With these new skills, I began to write small scripts to make testing easier. Next, I began
to test at the API level. Soon after, I was writing unit tests, which very few QAers were writing at that
time.  A year after starting at Epic, I was no longer intimidated by technical concepts. I was testing heavily
technical areas like environment management, batch scheduling, auditing, indexing, etc.
    <p>When I decided to pursue programming as a profession, I enrolled in Udacity's Intro to
    Programming Nanodegree. Soon after I found myself enrolled in Udacity's
    Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.</p>
    <p>However, I'd say that only 30% percent of my learning came from those
    courses. The rest is from a random assortment of MOOCs, textbooks, podcasts, blogposts, code documentation, stack overflow articles,     meetup.com events, and coding small projects myself. Self-guided learning is my thing.</p>
<p>And that's my favorite part of web development so far -- since the field's always changing, there's so much to learn. I'm ready to rise to the challenge, leave my comfort zone, and code!</p>
