    <p>Hey, I'm Zach. I majored in philosophy in college, so I have always enjoyed questioning things.Â 
      Post college, I took a QA job, not really knowing what it was, but knowing that I would be working for a cool, exciting software company.</p>
      <p>
      Once I learned what QA was all about, I discovered that I liked it! Then, in my pursuit of learning more about testing, being closer to the source code,
      I decided to 'dig under the hood' and teach myself programming -- and soon I became hooked.
      Now I'm a Sofware Development Engineer in Test (SDET), and haven't looked back since.  I currently work at
      <a href="https://www.reviewtrackers.com/careers/" target="_blank">ReviewTrackers</a> in Chicago as their Lead SDET. </p>

    <p>I love digging into problems.  My programming education comes from a random assortment of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), textbooks,
       podcasts, blogposts, stack overflow articles, meetup.com events, and small projects. When I'm not learning, I'm taking photography classes,
       improv classes, cooking something yummy, or managing the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Chicago-Seleniumistas/" target="_blank">Chicago Seleniumistas Meetup Group</a>.</p>
